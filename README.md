# Work Team Generator

## Description
This Work Team Generator uses Node.js, Inquirer and Jest to generate a webpage displaying a users work-team with their unique id's, roles, emails and so on. 
Through this application a user can select multiple different roles for their employees, enter their unique information and have that data displayed neatly on a webpage.
This application simplifies the process of creating a website for users by preparing a template HTML that adapts to Inquirer prompts, thus cutting out a lot of middle work a user might face trying to create  their  own webpage for their team's information.

The motivation behind building this application was to better understand how Javascript objects, classes and superconstructors work together. Similarly this application helped to foster a small example of how Jest tests can work.
The most challenging aspect of this application was figuring out how Inquirer can work with superconstructors and classes. Similarly figuring out how to call those classes' information within other scripts proved to be a challenge.
Overall this project reified my understanding of Inquirer and helped develop a deeper familiarity with object classes.

## Installation

The only requirement for this application to run is NodeJS and ensuring that both Inquirer and Node are up to date.
For tests one would need to install Jest if not already installed.
